# Lead_Scoring_Case_Study
This Project is based on the case study where "An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses". 
### Goal of the Case Study
*You have been chosen by **X Education** to assist them in choosing the most promising **leads**, or the prospects that are most likely to become paying customers. The business wants you to create a model where you give each lead a lead score so that leads with higher lead scores have a better likelihood of converting, while leads with lower lead scores have a lesser chance of converting. The CEO in particular has stated that **80%** is the objective *lead conversion rate*.

*Create a **logistic regression model** to provide each lead a lead score between 0 and 100 that the business may use to target potential prospects. In contrast, a lower number would indicate that the lead is chilly and unlikely to convert, while a higher score would indicate that the lead is hot and most likely to convert.
